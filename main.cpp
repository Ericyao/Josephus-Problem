//The Josephus problem is the following game: N people, numbered 1 to N, are sitting
//in a circle. Starting at person 1, a hot potato is passed. After M passes, the person
//holding the hot potato is eliminated, the circle closes ranks, and the game continues
//with the person who was sitting after the eliminated person picking up the
//hot potato. The last remaining person wins. Thus, if M = 0 and N = 5, players
//are eliminated in order, and player 5 wins. If M = 1 and N = 5, the order of
//elimination is 2, 4, 1, 5.
